Usage
-------------

See statsd_test for sample usage:

    from pystatsd import Client, Server

    srvr = Server(debug=True)
    srvr.serve()

    sc = Client('example.org',8125)

    sc.timing('python_test.time',500)
    sc.increment('python_test.inc_int')
    sc.decrement('python_test.decr_int')


Building a Debian Package
-------------

To build a debian package, run `dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot`

Upstart init Script
-------------
Upstart is the daemon management system for Ubuntu, and it's really great!

A basic upstart script has been included for the pystatd server. It's located 
under init/, and will be installed to /usr/share/doc if you build/install a 
.deb file. The upstart script should be copied to /etc/init/pystatd.conf and 
will read configuration variables from /etc/default/pystatd. By default, the 
pystatd daemon runs as user 'nobody' which is a good thing from a security 
perspective.
